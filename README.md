# Git and github laboratory

<h2>Description</h2>
Git practice laboratory. This is a throwaway repo that will hopefully be 
destroyed if I don't forget to do so later on. But it's just an exercise to 
practice manipulatin github repos. Which I should honestly be more than 
capable of doing, but...this is compulsory. So here's to hoping I'm not 
bragging then falling short.

    return a + b


def main():
    while input("Want sum more? ") in ["y", "Y"]:
        print(f"Doing sum work: {sum(int(input('First number? ')), int(input('Second number? ')))}")
